# LED-Bulbs
 This CLI program allows you to calculate the estimated energy saving you would achieve by changing your house's light bulbs from incandestent or halogen ones to LED ones. In order to do so, you must enter the light bulbs ammount, as well as the power consumption for each of them.
 
 You may also enter the cost of changing those bulbs and the price of electicity in your area, in order to calculate the payback time of the investment.
 
 I made this program as a school project in Sixth Form. I remember that this was the very first time I worked with a matrix as a data structure.
